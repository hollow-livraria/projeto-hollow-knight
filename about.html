                        </hgroup>
                        <p>Sly used to be the Great Nailsage. During his previous occupation, he trained some disciples
                            in the Nail Arts: Oro, Mato, and Sheo.
                            <br><br>
                            Eventually, Sly abandoned his occupation as Nailsage. He became convinced of the strength of
                            accumulating Geo over honing one's nail. He thus turned to the simple life of a merchant,
                            finding and selling wares from his shop in Dirtmouth. He did not, however, forget his
                            mastery and respect of the nail and those who practice its arts. He keeps his greatnail in
                            the basement of his shop and still remembers his pupils.

                        </hgroup>
                        <p>Leg Eater is blind but has a powerful sense of smell. He is a reserved bug who reacts with
                            anger at any threat he may perceive. He is fixated on earning Geo, believing that if he
                            has enough of it, it will make him become a king. Despite his own greed, he is prone to
                            accusing others of the same sin, even wrongfully.
                            <br><br>
                            Leg Eater is found in a camp in the Fungal Wastes, near the entrance to the Forgotten
                            Crossroads. When first meeting him, he offers to show the Knight "something nice".
